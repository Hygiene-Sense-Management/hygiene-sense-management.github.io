hmBody:"<p class=\"p_Normal\">Stationary gateway actively monitor the Bluetooth communication links with non-gateway devices and report the status of this links to the Data link monitoring service. The technical environment allows an immediate detection of newly established device connections (within a few seconds) and lost device connections (within 10s).<\/p>\n\r<p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>After startup of a stationary gateway and after a grace period for establishing Bluetooth connection to nearby devices stationary gateways report all device links to the Data link monitoring service.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>The stationary gateway continuously monitors Bluetooth connections to non-gateway devices and reports changes to the connection status to the Data link monitoring service immediately. Changes can be newly connected devices, or lost device connections.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>If the gateway looses internet connection (and therefore connection to the Data link monitoring service) it will cache status changes and will deliver the status changes for each device to the backend on re-connection. Caching is maximal for 48 h.<\/p><p class=\"p_Normal\" style=\"text-indent: 0; padding-left: 0.8125rem; margin-left: 0;\"><span class=\"f_Normal\" style=\"font-family: Arial,\'Lucida Sans Unicode\',\'Lucida Grande\',\'Lucida Sans\';display:inline-block;width:0.8125rem;margin-left:-0.8125rem\">&#8226;<\/span>Once every x hours the stationary gateway sends a status for all its connected devices, i.e. the backend can rely that it gets information about every connected device once every x hours, devices that do not get an update for x h are considered as offline then.<\/p>"
